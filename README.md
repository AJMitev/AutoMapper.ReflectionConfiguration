This repo is inspired from [Nikolay Kostov](https://github.com/NikolayIT) and the original code can be found in his project [PressCenter](https://github.com/NikolayIT/PressCenters.com/tree/master/src/Services/PressCenters.Services.Mapping). I extract mapping logic from there with a goal to make it easy for reuse in other projects.
